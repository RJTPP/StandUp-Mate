# StandUp Mate

**StandUp Mate** is a simplified, effective Arduino-based tool designed to combat office syndrome by encouraging users to stand up and take breaks at regular intervals. This project is a standalone version of [**ELEVATE-AI**](https://github.com/RJTPP/ELEVATE-AI), focused on promoting healthier work habits in a straightforward, user-friendly manner, without the need for AI features and environmental analysis.

## Features

- **Presence Detection**: Utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect when a user is at their desk.
- **Timed Reminders**: Encourages regular standing breaks by displaying messages on the OLED screen and flashing an LED light.
- **Standalone Operation**: Operates independently without the need for internet connectivity or external data processing.

## Hardware Components

- ESP32-S3 modules
- OLED Display I2C IIC 0.96â€³ SSD1306 128x64px
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Red, Green, Yellow LED (Optional)
- 220Î© Resistors (For LED lights)
- Push Button

## Software Dependencies

- Arduino IDE

### Arduino Libraries

- [`Wire`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/wire/) for I2C communications with sensors and display.
- [`Adafruit_SSD1306`](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306) for the OLED display control.
- [`HCSR04`](https://github.com/gamegine/HCSR04-ultrasonic-sensor-lib) for the ultrasonic distance measurements.

For more detail, please refer to the [`schematic.pdf`](/schematic.pdf) file.

### Software Configuration

1. Install the **Arduino IDE** on your computer.
2. Download and install the required libraries (`Adafruit SSD1306` and `HCSR04`) through the Library Manager in the Arduino IDE.
3. Open the [`standUpMate.ino`](/standUpMate/standUpMate.ino) sketch with the Arduino IDE.
4. Modify the [`hardwareConfig.h`](/standUpMate/hardwareConfig.h) file to configure the ESP32 pin definitions to match your hardware setup.
5. Update the sketch with your preferred timer settings and thresholds for the ultrasonic sensor.
6. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Power up **StandUp Mate** by connecting it to a USB power source or battery.
2. The device will automatically start monitoring for user presence.
3. Upon detecting a user, the timer begins counting down to the next break reminder.
4. When it's time for a break, the OLED display will show a message, and the LED will start flashing.
5. Stand up and take a break. The device will detect when you've left your seat.
6. Return to reset the timer automatically or use the reset button for manual reset.
